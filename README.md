# Drug_Overdose_Analysis
This project uses R for basic data visualization to show the number of deaths caused by Heroin, Fentanyl, Opioids, and Oxydone. The analysis segments the deaths by Race to determine which group is the most effective. To accommodate bias in population size per race I also plot the proportion of each group affected by these drugs.
