# Drug Overdose Analysis
This project uses R for basic data visualization to show the number of deaths caused by Heroin, Fentanyl, Opioids, and Oxydone. The analysis segments the deaths by Race to determine which group is being affected the most. To accommodate bias in population size per race I also plotted the proportion of each group affected by these drugs. The analysis was done using dataframes and ggplot. The dataset can be found [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/accidental-drug-related-deaths-january-2012-sept-2015)
